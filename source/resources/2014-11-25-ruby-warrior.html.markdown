[Rubywarrior Scoreboard](https://github.com/ruby-meetup-resources/rubywarrior_scoreboard) is a scoreboard website for ruby-warrior.  If you haven't seen
ruby-warrior, well, you play a little @ symbol battling its way past slime, archers and wizards, rescuing captives along the way.  Originally created by
Ryan Bates, it's a great learning tool, and more than enough to keep a meetup occupied for a few hours.

The website above needs to be used with the [scoreboard_rubywarrior gem](https://github.com/ruby-meetup-resources/scoreboard_rubywarrior) which wraps
Ryans gem and allows posting of results to the webserver.  It also posts the code, and runs flog over the code.  This is useful as you can see how other
(more experienced) people have approached the problem, and see neater ways of performing the same task.

Hopefully you get as much fun out of it as we did!

What to Contribute
------------------
Ideally we are looking for **hack night / game resources**  While we do have a list of learning ruby resources, this is more about tools in helping running a meetup.

ideally we are looking for things which are:</p>

* **Ready to go**. There shouldn't be too much configuration required to get the resource running.  Otherwise it's not making your life easier ;)
* **Have a collaboration / team / game environment.**There are lots of great resources out there for coding challeges etc (some listed on the
  beginner page), but what we're looking for is something "fun", like the robotwars, or a scoreboard for some sort of coding challenge type event.  Well, that's the ideal
  anyway, but sure it's all up for debate, and if you have something to contribute or a different idea, please, [open an issue on this repo](https://github.com/ruby-meetup-resources/ruby-meetup-resources.github.io/issues), or just send a pull request as outlined above.
